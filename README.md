# TensorFlow_Lite_RPi_64-bits
TensorFlow Lite running at 24 FPS on bare Raspberry Pi 4 with Ubuntu

A VERY fast C++ implementation of TensorFlow Lite on a bare Raspberry Pi 4.
The Raspberry Pi 64 bits Ubuntu version is used as operating system.
Once overclocked to 1925 MHz, the app runs a whooping 24 FPS!
Without any hardware accelerator, just you and your Pi.
